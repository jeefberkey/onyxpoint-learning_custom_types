#learning_custom_types

This module attempts to clearly delineate the execution of a custom type and
provider and demonstrate what you can do with each.

It is meant as a learning and teaching aid and should not be used in production
but may be a good place to start when developing a new custom type.

##Pry

If you want to step through the code using [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry),
set a **PRY** environment variable.

```bash
export PRY=true
```

To stop using Pry, simply unset the variable.

```bash
unset PRY
```

##Support

Please log tickets and issues in the
[Learning Custom Types](https://github.com/onyxpoint/puppet_modules/learning_custom_types)
project on GitHub.
